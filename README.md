Leading Question
Social networks are a very interesting application of a graph data structure. Individuals constantly utilize social media platforms to interact with one another. In order to explore social circles within Facebook, we will develop a graph to display social connections, represented as edges, between Facebook users, which will be represented as nodes. We plan to utilize a dataset representing social networks of Facebook users. The graph that we plan to develop will be an undirected graph, since we are interested in exploring the two way connection between users. We will be able to calculate the shortest path between two Facebook users. So, with this approach we will be able to explore our question of: utilizing our graph, given a Facebook user, who has a first degree and higher connection to this user? Also, which node is the most highly connected user that would likley be suggested as a Facebook friend?

Dataset Acquisition
Our team has chosen to use a dataset of social circles for Facebook. http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html

Data Format
The dataset is downloaded as a folder containing many files. These files are one of several types: nodeId.edges : This contains the undirected edges in the ego network for the node 'nodeI’. The 'ego' node does not appear, but it is assumed that they follow every node id that appears in this file. nodeId.circles : The set of circles for the ego node. Each line contains one circle, consisting of a series of node ids. The first entry in each line is the name of the circle. nodeId.feat : The features for each of the nodes that appears in the edge file. nodeId.egofeat : The features for the ego user. nodeId.featnames : The names of each of the feature dimensions. Features are '1' if the user has this property in their profile, and '0' otherwise.

Data Correction
Our project will incorporate various checks to ensure the input data is correct while reading it into our program. One of these checks will include validation of every Facebook social circle to make sure that every node belongs to the proper social circle. When encountering an issue with a node not belonging to a social circle it’s supposed to, we’ll correct the issue and sort the node to its proper social circle. If we find there are missing nodes when validating the social circles, we’ll fill in for those nodes by creating nodes as place holders to fill in the holes in the dataset.

Data Storage
We are going to be using an undirected graph in order to represent the connections between people. There will be one undirected edge between people if only one is following the other, or else if they both follow each other there will be two undirected edges connecting them. Our estimated total storage cost is O(n^2). This is because it is O(n) to access 1 element and then another O(n) to access an element from the first element in our adjacency list structure that will represent our undirected graph.

Graph algorithms
We plan to utilize PageRank. We are interested in implmenting PageRank in order to find the most popular/highly connected node. We think that by implmenting this algorithm, we can make an insightful analysis as to which Facebook user is the most high connected, and thus would be likley to be suggested to other users to connect with on Facebook.

We plan to utilize Dijkstra’s algorithm utilizing a BFS in order to find the shortest path between two Facebook users in our graph. We chose to implement this algorithm for shortest path in order to find the degree of connectivity between 2 users.

In determining the shortest path between nodes to determine the first, second, etc degrees of connectivity between two Facebook users, we will take two inputs. The two inputs will be a Facebook user(source) and the adjacency matrix that represents a graph. Given the fact that our leading question aims to find the first degree connections among Facebook users, we expect the output of our algorithm to provide the degrees of connections of a given Facebook user.

We have determined that the runtime of BFS search is O(n) given the loops that will be utilized. We then determined that the PageRank algorithm has a O(n + m) runtime, where n represents the number of nodes in our undirected graph and m is the number of edges. For Dijkstra's, the runtime is O(n^2), where n represents the number of nodes in our undirected graph.


Timeline
Plan project and create project proposal (week 1) Data acquisition (week 2) Data processing (week 2) Completion of each individual algorithm (week 3) Production of final deliverables (week 4)

Github Organization: The main branch hosts all of the files for our project. The src folder contains the AdjacencyMatrix.cc file which contains code to create the adjacency matrix, the bfs algorithm, dijkstra's algorithm, and PageRank algorithm. The Facebook.cc file has the code that reads in the dataset file and creates a vector to store all the data.


Running Instructions: The code must be cloned from GitHub by typing the command git clone https://github.com/Adam-Shore/cs225FinalProject.git . The code can be executed by running the command make test or g++ -std=c++20 -Iincludes/ src/driver.cc src/facebook.cc src/AdjacencyMatrix.cc -o bin/tests. The next step is to run the command ./bin/tests which runs all test cases. The test case file contains test cases for the bfs algorithm, dijkstra's algorithm, and PageRank algorithm.
